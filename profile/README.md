# CopyRightCheck Developers

Welkom/Welcome! 

This organization is meant for all people working with [CopyrightCheck](https://servicedesk.surf.nl/wiki/spaces/WIKI/pages/102826599/CopyrightCheck), the tool developed by [SURF](https://www.surf.nl/) for classifying & reporting on copyrighted materials in our LMS's. 

The goal/aim of this organization is to collaborate on useful tooling, software, demos, scripts, best practices, workarounds, extensions, implementations, ...: whatever helps to do the job of classifying items!

For now there's not much to see here, just a placeholder! Get in touch with [utsmok](http://github.com/utsmok)/[Samuel Mok](mailto:s.mok@utwente.nl) for more info.
